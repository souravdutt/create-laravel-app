## The S6 Vision

Inspired by the T3 Stack, we're reimagining Laravel development with modern tooling to make PHP development more robust and enjoyable. Our goals include:

- **Run Anywhere/Everywhere**: Pure npm-based installation (no curl commands needed)
- **Single Command Setup**: Install everything with one command
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration for better developer experience
- **Linting**: Built-in code quality tools
- **Modern Database Layer**: Prisma-like database management with type safety
- **SPA Integration**: Seamless single-page application support
- **Validation**: Zod-powered schema validation
- **Type-Safe APIs**: tRPC-style communication between PHP backend and frontend (detect changes in controllers and get errors in Blade/frontend)

These enhancements aim to bring PHP development into the modern era, combining Laravel's power with cutting-edge tools.

## S6 Principles

### 1. Solve Real Problems

We focus on adding features that address genuine pain points in Laravel development. Everything included should provide clear value without unnecessary complexity.

### 2. Modernize Responsibly

We embrace modern tools and practices while maintaining Laravel's reliability. We prioritize stability for core functionality while experimenting with innovative features.

### 3. Type Safety Isn't Optional

Full-stack type safety is our north star. Any feature that compromises type safety should be implemented elsewhere.

This creates a fully functional Laravel project with bundled PHP and Composer binaries.
